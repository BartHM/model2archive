CP/M Plus

This is the Radio Shack release of CP/M Plus (aka CP/M 3.0)

This was released as a 4 disk set.  We have 2 different versions with incomplete sets.  However, both versions have the critical unbanked system disk which allows you to use CP/M with 64K.

CPM_Plus_TRS-80_Model_4_Reference_Manual.pdf

This is the Model 4 manual for CP/M Plus.  From looking through it it looks very relevant to the Model II version so we will include this copy until we find a copy of the CP/M Plus Manual for the Model II.
