TRS-80 Model II/12/16
CP/M Plus
Version 01.00.00


CPMPLUS.IMD
Single-Sided
System Disk

This looks to be almost a pristine copy of CP/M Plus for the Model II, except for a few issues:

1. PROFILE.SUB set up for a dual disk
2. ED.COM is missing
3. Includes MBASIC.COM
4. There may be other issues



CPM_Plus_TRS-80_Model_4_Reference_Manual.pdf

This is the Model 4 manual for CP/M Plus.  From looking through it it looks very relevant to the Model II version so we will include this copy until we find a copy of the CP/M Plus Manual for the Model II.
