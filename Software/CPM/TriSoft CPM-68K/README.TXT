TriSoft CP/M-68K
CP/M-68K for the Model 16

There are currently 2 different sets of the CP/M-68K software obtained from different sources.  Set1 is from the old Maslin archives.  We leave it to the CP/M experts to determine which is the more complete working set.  The documentation specifies a 6 disk set.  Please let us know if you are able to install the software and get it running or if you have expertise with this operating system and can offer more guidance.
