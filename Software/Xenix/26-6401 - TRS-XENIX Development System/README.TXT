26-6401
TRS-XENIX Development System
v1.2.0

This is the software development system v1.2.0 for TRS-XENIX 1.x.

There are several packages here, each one imaged from different sources.

26-6401a seems to be complete but has one known issue with the AS program on disk #2 which is not working properly.

26-6401b has a few issues.  It is missing disk #7.  Disk #8 core dumps.

To get a good working installation, it is suggested to use 26-6401a, but replace disk #2 with the disk #2 from 26-6401b.

There may be other known issues, which is why all imaged sets are being made available.
