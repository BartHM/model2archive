Snapp-Ware

The function of this software is currently unknown.  

The gregutil program looks like a modified version of XENIX 1.x diskutil.  It only supports floppy and hard drives when run, not cartridges as the XENIX 3.x diskutil does.

The z80ctl program is a modified version of XENIX 3.1.x z80ctl.  It does appear to have tape drive support built-in as there are messages like "TAPE ERROR" and "TAPE INTERFACE NOT AVAILABLE" found at the end of the program.  It is unknown how to access the tape functionality at this time.
