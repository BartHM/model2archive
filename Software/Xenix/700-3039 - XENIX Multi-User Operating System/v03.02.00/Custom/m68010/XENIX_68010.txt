	  MC68010 PROCESSOR SUPPORT FOR THE TANDY 16B/6000
	      XENIX/68000  Version 3.2(42a)  9 Nov 1987


    The kernel in this directory will allow owners of Tandy Model 16A,
16B,  and  Tandy  6000  systems  to  use  an MC68010 microprocessor of
identical speed in their CPU board in place of the standard 68000.

    The kernel changes to allow this were confined to one area.   They
have  been  heavily  used  on  the  systems  used  by the XENIX System
Programmers with no  problems.   The  68010  is  completely  backwards
compatible.  There are no application software changes required to run 
on a 68010.

    At this time, however, this version of /xenix  IS  NOT  officially
supported  or  approved  of  by Tandy Corporation or Radio Shack.  The
contents of this directory are provided "as is", witout  any  warranty
of  any  kind.   It  is  entirely  the  responsibility  of the user to
determine whether these files should be used with the  users'  system.
The  user  shall  make any adjustments or corrections necessary to use
these materials.  There is no commitment of any kind to provide  these
materials in a supported or unsupported form in the future.

    When reporting problems with your system, make  sure  the  problem
persists  when  running  with  the  standard  release of the operating
system.  (Yes, you have to put the 68000 back in to run  the  standard
release)

    Also, if you take your machine in for repair, BE SURE you  replace
the  68010 with the standard 68000, or the repair folk may think it is
bad and replace it with a 68000 (their diagnostics will not run  on  a
68010, sorry).

    This kernel was benchmarked against the regular kernel, and  while
there  were  improvments  in  several  areas, they were slight.  It is
doubtful that any significant performance improvement will be noticed.

    For a list of the differences between the 68010 microprocessor and
the  68000  consult  the  M68000 PROGRAMMER'S REFERENCE MANUAL, fourth
edition.
