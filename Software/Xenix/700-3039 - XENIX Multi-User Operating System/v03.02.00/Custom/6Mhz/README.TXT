XENIX 3.2.0 6Mhz Patched Boot Disk

This is a patched boot disk to allow XENIX 3.2.0 to run on a Model 16 or 16B with a non-PAL upgraded 6MHz board.  The patches disable the checks for the upgraded PAL chips and also turn off “burst mode” which was introduced in XENIX 3 and only works with the upgraded PAL chips.

See the Model 16 Technical Bulletin 16:023 for details about the PAL upgrade for 6MHz boards.

For a discussion on the PAL upgrade and burst mode, see https://groups.google.com/forum/#!topic/comp.sys.tandy/HSTKgp_TbFg
