XENIX Multi-User Operating System for Enhanced Model II
v03.02.00

This is the final release v3.2.0 of XENIX in the single-sided disk format.  It was a special order for those few customers who had upgraded their Model II to Tandy 6000 specifications.  The final XENIX installation is exactly the same as that achieved in the standard installation set.
