Are you tired of the irritating form feed when you do a printout?  Did
you ever wonder how you could print single labels like from Profile 16
without this problem?  Why in the hell did Profile 16 provide form printing
from a screen when you can't control the form feed.  Here is the answer:


To change the printer device to clp:
Patch /usr/lib/lpd
Patch bytes 398b to 63
            398c to 6c
            398d to 70
