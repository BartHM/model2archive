Below is the fix so uucp and the dialer can go faster than 1200 baud.

First, edit /usr/lib/uucp/dial.c for the correct speeds and recompile. 
You will see a file called link_dial that contains the compile options.  
Just make it executable and run it and make this your new dialer.

Add these to /usr/lib/uucp/L-devices:

ACU	cul0	cua0.9600	9600
ACU	cul0	cua0.2400	2400

ACU	cul1	cua0.9600	9600
ACU	cul1	cua0.2400	2400

Last, you must rm certain cu devices and link them to your tty devices
in the /dev directory.

rm /dev/cua0*
rm /dev/cul0
rm /dev/cua1*
rm /dev/cul1


Your devices must look like the ones below.  Notice how I added
2400 and 9600 cu's.  This is what my cu devices look like.  Notice
how each one contains 7 links to each tty.

Link "ln" these to /dev/tty01
crw-rw-rw-   7 root     root       0,  1 Feb 27 23:48 /dev/cua0
crw-rw-rw-   7 root     root       0,  1 Feb 27 23:48 /dev/cua0.1200
crw-rw-rw-   7 root     root       0,  1 Feb 27 23:48 /dev/cua0.2400
crw-rw-rw-   7 root     root       0,  1 Feb 27 23:48 /dev/cua0.300
crw-rw-rw-   7 root     root       0,  1 Feb 27 23:48 /dev/cua0.9600
crw-rw-rw-   7 root     root       0,  1 Feb 27 23:48 /dev/cul0

Link "ln" these to /dev/tty02
crw-rw-rw-   7 root     root       0,  2 Mar  6 21:48 /dev/cua1
crw-rw-rw-   7 root     root       0,  2 Mar  6 21:48 /dev/cua1.1200
crw-rw-rw-   7 root     root       0,  2 Mar  6 21:48 /dev/cua1.2400
crw-rw-rw-   7 root     root       0,  2 Mar  6 21:48 /dev/cua1.300
crw-rw-rw-   7 root     root       0,  2 Mar  6 21:48 /dev/cua1.9600
crw-rw-rw-   7 root     root       0,  2 Mar  6 21:48 /dev/cul1


You also notice that logent.o and ulockf.o are located in /usr/lib/uucp.
This has to do with logging uucp and locking the dial port.  Unfortunately,
this code was never included in dial.c and there are no docs for how to include
it in the dialer.  If anyone figures this out, please kindly tell me.
