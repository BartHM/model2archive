MDX is a medical office management suite for the TRS-80 Model 16 running TRS-XENIX.  It’s noted as a demo but appears to perform a full installation.

This is a two disk TRS-XENIX package. 

Notes: 

1. First you need to make a user named “mdx” using “mkuser” as root.
2. To install, type "install" after login as root.
3. Note: the installation is lengthy.
