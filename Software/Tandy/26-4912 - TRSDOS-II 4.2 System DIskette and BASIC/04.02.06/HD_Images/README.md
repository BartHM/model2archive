# HD_Images Folder

This folder contains hard disk images of TRSDOS-II Version 4.2.6 for selected hard drive emulators.  Each included emulator contains its own folder.  

* **DREM**: Contains the .dsk and matching .cfg file for use on your DREM when paired with a 8x300-based controller.
* **DG**: Contains the .emu file for use on the David Gesswein MFM Reader/Emulator.

As the FreHD4Eight (F48) emulates a WD1010 controller, TRSDOS 4.2.6 is not relevant for it.
